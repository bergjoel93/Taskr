Things to finish: 
* Add a header to html document
* style the edit and trash buttons to only show when hovering over element. 
* add class to overdue tasks so that they have some nice styling that they're overdue. Highlight date. 
* complete completed task logic
* print completed tasks below incomplete task
* add headers "Today", "All Tasks", "Complete"
* figure out how to publish to pages. 
* Above and beyond: make notification button work. If it's clicked, it will show overdue items.
